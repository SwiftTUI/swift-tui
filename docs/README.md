# Documentation Index

This directory is the current-state documentation set for the repository.
Landed work that no longer changes decisions has been folded into the
surviving source-of-truth docs rather than kept around as historical roadmaps
or superseded plans.

Per-target API reference lives in the `*.docc` catalogs under `Sources/`:

```bash
swiftly run swift package generate-documentation --target SwiftTUI
```

The repository [README.md](../README.md) is the public landing page.
[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md) is the short guide for agentic assistants.
[`TODO.md`](TODO.md) tracks planned work and unresolved decisions, and
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md) records completed TODO history.
