# ADR-0007: Platform integration packages are peers, not root products

Superseded by
[ADR-0016](0016-platform-products-live-in-root-package.md) on 2026-05-11.
`Platforms/` remains the source ownership map, but Swift platform integration
products now live in the root `Package.swift`.

## Context

A SwiftTUI app eventually has to render somewhere concrete: a
terminal process, a SwiftUI macOS / iOS surface, a Bun-served browser
canvas, or a WASI runtime. Each of those targets has different platform
chrome, different scene-switching UI conventions, different theme
surfaces, and different toolchain dependencies.

The naive shape would be to fold all of these into the root
`swift-tui` package — exporting library products like
`SwiftTUI`, `SwiftUIHost`, `WebHost`,
`SwiftTUICLI`, etc., from a single Package.swift. That keeps everything
in one place and makes "import what you need" feel uniform.

It also drags every consumer through every host-platform's transitive
dependency tree, makes it impossible to ship a SwiftUI host without
also shipping a Bun build configuration in the workspace, and forces
host-platform UX choices (scene tabs, picker chrome, style mapping)
into the same review surface as the core library's public API.

## Decision

Platform integration packages live as **peer SwiftPM packages** alongside the
root package, not as products inside it:

```
swift-tui/
├── Sources/                ← root package products
└── Platforms/
    ├── CLI/                ← peer executable runner package
    ├── WASI/               ← peer executable runner package
    ├── SwiftUI/            ← peer embedded host package
    ├── Web/                ← peer embedded host package
    └── WebHost/            ← compound WebHost runner/browser-host package
```

The root package exposes scene-manifest and hosted-session APIs
(`SceneDescriptor`, `SceneManifest`,
`HostedSceneSession`) so peer packages can build on supported types
without reaching into package-only internals. Each peer owns:

- its window-or-browser-shell integration,
- native or canvas surface embedding,
- scene tabs, pickers, and other host-local chrome,
- host-specific style mapping and theme swapping.

The root package does not own any of those.

## Status

Superseded on 2026-05-11 by ADR-0016. This ADR remains as the historical
record for why the project originally split platform integrations into nested
SwiftPM packages.

## Consequences

**Enabled:**

- Consumers opt into the platform integration package they need without paying
  the cost of the others. A pure terminal-native app does not transitively pull
  Bun, WASM SDKs, SwiftUI dependencies, or the WebHost server stack.
- Each embedded host package can evolve its UX (scene picker chrome, theme
  handling) independently of the root package's public-surface
  policy review.
- New hosts (e.g. an Android JNI host, a TipTap-style web embedding)
  can be added as new peer packages without touching the root
  package or its review checklist.

**Foreclosed:**

- The root package does not generate Xcode project files, host
  custom desktop chrome, or own a single cross-platform app shell.
  Those concerns belong to consumers.
- A consumer cannot import "SwiftTUI" and get executable launch or a SwiftUI
  host for free — they pick the runner or embedded host package explicitly.

**Discipline imposed:**

- Embedded host packages cannot introduce dependencies on root-package
  package-only internals. If they need something, the root package
  exposes it as supported API.
- The control-message contract for resize and render-style updates
  is the supported boundary. Hosts that need new behavior either
  use the existing contract or propose an extension to it.

The bet: small, focused root products plus opinionated peer hosts
scale better than one large package that has to please every
deployment target. Five years from now this matters more than today.
