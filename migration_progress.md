# Production Code Humanization Progress

## Current Status

Started repo-wide production-code humanization on branch `humanize`.

Approved constraints:

- Preserve public SwiftUI-like APIs.
- Do not change examples.
- Keep test coverage and repo gate strength intact.
- Begin with primary terminal rendering infrastructure.
- Use subagents and review their work.

## Completed

- Loaded `positive-humanize-existing-code`.
- Loaded batch-refactor and parallel-agent orchestration guidance.
- Confirmed repo branch and absence of existing migration artifacts.
- Reviewed repo guidance in `AGENTS.md`.
- Reviewed architecture, render-pipeline, and development docs.
- Spawned read-only subagents for terminal host, frame pipeline, runtime/CLI
  integration, and validation mapping.
- Created initial scope, plan, progress, and handoff artifacts.
- Packet 1 completed: extracted terminal presentation writer/session state from
  `TerminalHost.swift` into `TerminalPresentationState.swift`.
- Packet 2 completed: extracted terminal presentation emission and metrics
  bookkeeping from `TerminalHost.present(_:damage:)`.

## Baseline Validation

Passed before production-code edits:

- `bun run test`
- Full log: `/tmp/swift-tui-test-gate-20260518-023359-77501.log`
- Result: PASS

Packet 1 validation:

- `swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.TerminalHostPresentationBatchingTests`
  - Result: PASS
- `swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.TerminalGraphicsProtocolTests`
  - Result: PASS
- `bun run test`
  - Full log: `/tmp/swift-tui-test-gate-20260518-024018-4112.log`
  - Result: PASS

Packet 2 validation:

- `swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.TerminalHostPresentationBatchingTests`
  - Result: PASS
- `swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.TerminalPresentationTests`
  - Result: PASS
- `swiftly run swift test --filter SwiftTUITests.TerminalGraphicsProtocolTests`
  - Result: PASS
- `bun run test`
  - Full log: `/tmp/swift-tui-test-gate-20260518-024705-20556.log`
  - Result: PASS

## Next Slice

Packet 3: make frame-tail/artifact flow easier to trace while preserving phase
products and frame-drop semantics.

Expected owned files pending local discovery:

- `Sources/SwiftTUIRuntime/Rendering/`
- `Sources/SwiftTUICore/Commit/`

Validation:

- Pipeline/rendering focused tests selected from current file evidence.
- `bun run test`

## Failed Attempts

None.

## Known Risks

- `TerminalHost.swift`, `TerminalPresentation.swift`,
  `TerminalImageRendering.swift`, `FrameTailRenderer.swift`, and
  `RunLoop+Rendering.swift` are large and heavily tested shared runtime files.
- The checkout path ends in `swift-tui.humanize`; repo docs warn that example
  path dependencies prefer a final path component of `swift-tui`. The baseline
  gate still passed in this checkout.
- Swift incremental build artifacts may become stale; clean build state when
  unexplained crashes or impossible diagnostics appear.
- Rendering fixtures should not change unless an intentional rendering behavior
  change is separately approved.
