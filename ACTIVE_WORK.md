# Active Work

## Rules

- Keep this document up to date whenever active tasks are added, completed, or
  re-scoped.
- Include only work that is not yet completed.
- Use concise task descriptions with links to supporting docs, plans, source
  files, or tests.
- Remove completed work from this document entirely.
- When removing completed work, add a concise self-standing entry to
  [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md). Keep long-form details in the supporting docs,
  plans, source, or tests.
- Changelog entries may link to long-lived repo documentation, but every link
  must be prefixed with the short git hash that anchors the referenced material,
  for example: `4ee7a8f9 [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md)`.
- Treat this file as additive to the repo documentation structure. It does not
  replace durable docs, proposals, ADRs, plans, or tests.
- Use this file as the first place to check what is next.

## Runtime And Public Surface Gaps

- [ ] Turn the current constraints in `docs/STATUS.md` into executable plans or
  explicitly defer them: default-focus scopes, `@FocusedObject`, richer
  `TextEditor`, `NavigationStack`, popover-style presentation, terminal
  workspaces, deeper scroll control, and navigation surfaces. Supporting docs:
  [docs/STATUS.md](docs/STATUS.md),
  [docs/VISION.md](docs/VISION.md),
  [docs/FOCUS.md](docs/FOCUS.md).
  Ambiguity note: park this for later investigation. Some listed constraints
  may already be obsolete, so this remains a prioritization pass rather than a
  single implementation task.
